					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>Looking out for your well-being both mentally and physically is <strong>more important</strong> than any job you will have. If your health suffers, your work suffers. If your workplace is toxic, it can have serious effects on your health. It's crucial to find a happy balance of a good workplace and good health. No job is perfect, but there is no point in suffering.</p>
